# CodingChallengeNcino
Coding challenge for nCino.
This project contains the code for an assignment named "Coding Challenge".
The code opens the URL "https://todomvc.com/". From there, it locates "Angular 2.0" from "Labs" div.
This is single page architecture framework. The new page open, its our 1st task to input some text in the inputField & press ENTER from keyboard as we dont have a submit button.
For the next step, we locate the saved text we entered during Scenario 1, its our task to edit it. 
We now use clear() method to clear the text & use send.Keys to add a new text for "Test Scenario 2"
We close the webbrowser using close(); method
